     * Given an array arr of integers, check if there exists two integers N and M such that N is the double of M ( i.e. N = 2 * M).
     *
     * Input: arr = [10,2,5,3]
     * Output: true
     * Explanation: N = 10 is the double of M = 5,that is, 10 = 2 * 5.
     *
     * Hint: you may use additional data structure to help.
