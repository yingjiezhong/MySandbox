    /**
     * https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/525/inserting-items-into-an-array/3245/
     * Input: [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
     * Output: null
     * Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
     *
     *
     * hint 1: use queue
     * hint 2: If we had enough space available, we would be able to accommodate all the elements properly.
     * The new length would be the original length of the array plus the number of zeros. Can we use this
     * information somehow to solve the problem?
